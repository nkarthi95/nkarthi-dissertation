Bijels require a multiscale modeling approach to accurately capture the rich array of physical phenomena 
occurring across multiple length and time scales. Within a bijel, one must consider fluid flow, phase separation, particle-fluid coupling, and interparticle 
interactions. The length scales of interest range in the hundreds of nanometer to  tens of micron scale, demanding a model capable of resolving fine structural details while also 
capturing mesoscale dynamics. In the following sections, a comprehensive review of the relevant physical processes is provided, laying the foundation for the 
numerical methods used in this work.

\section{Hydrodynamics}

We begin with a restatement of Reynolds Transport Theorem (RTT) which relates the accumulation of a parameter within a control volume to the difference between the values
of the parameter entering and leaving the volume and the generation and consumption within the volume. The derivation from page 135 to 147 in reference \cite{batchelor_introduction_2000}
is followed. For a non moving and non-deforming volume, the transport equation is given by,

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{dt} \int \theta \rho \, dV = \int Q \, dV - \int \theta \rho (\vec{v}_{\text{surf}} \cdot \vec{n}) \, dA
\end{equation}

Where $\theta$ is an intensive quantity of the system such as mass, momentum or energy, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid in the control volume, $Q$ is an effective density
of a source, $V$ is the volume of the control element, $t$ is time, $\vec{v}_{surf}$ is the velocity vector 
of the surface of the volume element and $\vec{n}$ is the surface normal unit vector. \cite{batchelor_introduction_2000} Using the divergence theorem, the expression can be rewritten as

\begin{equation}
    \int \frac{\partial \theta \rho}{\partial t} \, dV = \int Q \, dV - \int \nabla \cdot (\theta \rho \vec{v}_{\text{surf}}) \, dV
\end{equation}

If $\theta = 1$ and $Q = 0$ the continuity equation for fluid density can be written to analyze the mass flux of a control volume given by,

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot\left(\rho\vec{u}\right) = 0
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the fluid density and $\vec{u}$ is the fluid velocity. Based on the system being modeled, we assume that the fluid is incompressible, reducing the continuity equation to
$\nabla\cdot \vec{u} = 0$ The momentum conservation equation can also be written by applying Newton's second law to the fluid element. This yields the Cauchy momentum equation for an
incompressible fluid, where changes in momentum arise due to pressure gradients, viscous stresses, and body forces. The general form of the momentum equation is given by,

\begin{equation}
    \rho \left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} + (u_i\cdot\frac{\partial u_i}{x_i}) \right) = \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}}{\partial x_j} + f_i
\end{equation}

where $f_i$ is the force exerted on the fluid from external forces such as gravity or magnetic interactions and $\sigma_{ij}$ is the stress tensor. For a Newtonian, isotropic fluid, 
the viscous stress tensor is given by

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{ij} = -p\delta_{ij} + \eta((\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}) - \frac{2}{3}(\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i})^2\delta_{ij})
\end{equation}

Substituting this stress tensor into the momentum equation and using the relation, $\nabla\cdot \vec{u} = 0$ from the incompressibility constraint, the incompressible 
Navier-Stokes equation can be derived which in vector notation is given by,

\begin{equation}
    \rho \left(\frac{\partial\vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u} \right) = -\nabla p + \eta \nabla^2 \vec{u} + \vec{f}
\end{equation}

In the single component case, $-\nabla p = \vec{f} = 0$ as there are no external forces like gravity acting on the fluid and there are is no hydrodynamic pressure being applied to the 
fluid resulting in the following form of the incompressible Navier Stokes equation.

\begin{equation}
    \rho \left(\frac{\partial\vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u} \right) = \eta \nabla^2 \vec{u}
\end{equation}

To facilitate numerical simulation and analysis, it is often useful to express the Navier-Stokes equation in non-dimensional form. Introducing characteristic scales for length 
$l_0$, time $t_0$, and density $\rho_0$, dimensionless variables are defined as

\begin{equation}
    \bar{l} = \frac{l}{l_0}, \quad \bar{t} = \frac{t}{t_0}, \quad \bar{\rho} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_0}
\end{equation}

Substituting these into the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation leads to the dimensionless form:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \bar{\vec{u}}}{\partial \bar{t}} + (\bar{\vec{u}} \cdot\nabla)\bar{\vec{u}} = \frac{1}{Re} \nabla^2 \bar{\vec{u}}
\end{equation}

where the Reynolds number is defined as $Re = \frac{\rho_0 u_0 l_0}{\eta}$ which characterizes the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in the system.

\section{Phase separation}

Bijels form through spinodal decomposition of two partially miscible fluids, a process that can be effectively modeled using the Cahn-Hilliard equation. \cite{cahn_spinodal_1961} While the
original equation is written for a concentration of species $c$. For a binary mixture, it can be recast in terms of a conserved scalar order parameter $\phi$, typically representing the 
local concentration difference between the two fluid components,

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \left( M \nabla \mu \right)
\end{equation}

Here, $M$ is the mobility coefficient and $\mu$ is the chemical potential, which is derived from the variation of the free energy functional $F[\phi]$ which is the sum of a bulk free energy
$f(\phi)$ and an interfacial contribution. This formulation allows for the modeling of 
interfacial tension and the spontaneous formation of bicontinuous domains characteristic of spinodal decomposition.
To capture not only the diffusive separation of phases but also the resulting fluid motion, the Cahn-Hilliard equation is coupled with the Navier-Stokes equations, leading to the 
Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) framework. This coupling is essential in systems like bijels, where advection play a significant role in domain coarsening and morphology arrest. 
The momentum conservation equation in this framework is given by,

\begin{equation}
    \rho \left(\frac{\partial\vec{u}}{\partial t} + (\vec{u}\cdot\nabla)\vec{u} \right) = \eta \nabla^2 \vec{u} - \nabla p - \phi \nabla \mu
\end{equation}

% Here, $\vec{u}$ is the velocity field, $\rho$ is the fluid density, and $\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity. The term $P_{\text{therm}}$ represents the thermodynamic pressure tensor, which incorporates 
% contributions from gradients in the order parameter and is directly linked to the chemical potential \(\mu\). This tensor encodes the capillary and interfacial forces arising from phase separation 
% and effectively couples the compositional dynamics to the fluid flow.

The CHNS model enables simulation of complex phase-separating fluid systems, capturing both the interfacial evolution and the momentum transfer within the fluid. In the context of bijels, this 
model can be used to predict the formation and stabilization of the bicontinuous structure, especially when interfacial jamming by colloidal particles is introduced in more advanced extensions.

\section{Implementing the multicomponent Lattice Boltzmann Method} 
\label{section:lbm_hydrodynamics}

The lattice boltzmann method works by evolving a population distribution $f_{i}(\mathbf{x}, t)$ on a cubic lattice with 
timestep $\Delta t$ with lengthscale $\Delta x$. \cite{qian_lattice_1992, succi_lattice_2018, he_theory_1997} The cubic lattice or stencil is described
DnQm where n and m represent the number of dimensions and directions in the stencil. \cite{succi_lattice_2018, schmieschek_lb3d_2017}
Common stencils include the D1Q5, D2Q9 and D3Q19 stencil, all of which recover mass and momentum conservation and are Galilean invariant.
For energy conservation, a higher order stencil such as D3Q27 is necessary. The D2Q9 and D3Q19 stencils have 9 and 19 populations respectively that include 
connections to nearest and next nearest neighbour points. The D3Q19 
velocity set is used in this work with the indexes $i$ represent each of the 19 velocities and conserves mass and momentum 
to the second order. It can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:d3q19_lattice}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 1]{figures/methods/d3q19_lattice.jpg}
    \caption{D3Q19 lattice demonstrating the rest, nearest and next nearest direction that correspond to the 19 
    directions $(i)$ of the lattice with lattice velocity $c_{i}$. \cite{schmieschek_lb3d_2017} Reproduced from 
    Schmieschek et al. Computer Physics Communications 2017, 217, 149--161, under the CC-BY license.}
    \label{fig:d3q19_lattice}
\end{figure}

The LBM is composed of a collision and advection step. In the advection step, the populations at each grid point are propagated to adjacent points in accordance 
with the chosen stencil. During the collision step, the particle population distribution is relaxed towards an equilibrium with a collision operator, at a 
specified relaxation rate. It can take multiple forms depending on the number of
relaxation rates used. The most commonly used variant is the Single Relaxation Time (SRT) operator defined with the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) 
collision operator \cite{bhatnagar_model_1954, qian_lattice_1992}. The BGK model is easy to implement and works well enough in soft matter and
particle-laden flow simulations.

However the BGK operator controls all moments at a single relaxation rate which can induce numerical instabilities and inaccuracies
at higher fluid velocities. \cite{liu_simulation_2023, adhikari_fluctuating_2005} These numerical instabilities can be resolved by using
a Multiple Relaxation Time (MRT) collision operator. However the relaxation rates used in an MRT collision operator must be tuned carefully
to ensure that the appropriate fluid properties are modelled. Simpler variants of the MRT collision operator such as the Two Relaxation Time (TRT)
collision operator have been proposed as a solution that provides some of the benefits of MRT models with the simplicity of SRT models. These 
have facilitated simulation of a wider range of physical phenomena \cite{adhikari_fluctuating_2005, liu_simulation_2023}. The SRT collision 
operator is selected due to the additional computational performance needed by MRT not being needed. The combined streaming and 
collision step in LBM, using the BGK operator, is expressed in Equation \ref{eq:LBM_BGK}.

\begin{equation}
    f_{i}(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{c}_{i}\Delta t, t + \Delta t) = f_{i}(\mathbf{x}, t) - \frac{1}{\tau}(f_{i}(\mathbf{x}, t) 
    - f_{i}^{eq}(\mathbf{x}, t))
    \label{eq:LBM_BGK}
\end{equation}

The BGK operator limits simulations to low reynolds number and mach numbers to prevent numerical instabilities. 
\cite{qian_lattice_1992} The kinematic viscosity, if using the BGK operator, is obtained from the Chapman-Enskog expansion of \ref{eq:LBM_BGK}
as $\nu = c_s^2(\tau - \frac{\Delta t}{2})$. The equilibrium distribution is obtained from a projection of the 
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution onto Hermite polynomials. \cite{he_theory_1997, succi_lattice_2018} This is shown in equation 
\ref{eq:LBM_Feq}.

\begin{equation}
    f_{i}^{eq}(\rho, \vec{u}) = w_i\rho(1 + \frac{\mathbf{c_i} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{c_s^2} + \frac{ \vec{u}(c_{i,\alpha}c_{i,\beta}-c_s^2\mathbb{I}) }{2c_s^4})
    % \frac{(\mathbf{c_i} \cdot \mathbf{u})^2}{2c_s^4} + \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{2c_s^2})
    \label{eq:LBM_Feq}
\end{equation}

$\rho$ and $\textbf{u}$ in Equation \ref{eq:LBM_Feq} are defined as the macroscopic parameters for density and velocity 
and can be calculated from the mass distribution using $\rho = \sum f_i$ and $\rho \mathbf{u} = \sum f_i \mathbf{c}_i$ 
respectively. Using the Chapman-Enskog expansion, the Navier-Stokes equation at the incompressible limit at low Mach
numbers can be recovered. \cite{qian_lattice_1992, he_lattice_1997} The regime accessible through this method is suitable 
for simulations in this work as the $ 1 \leq Re \leq 100 $ and the mach number, $Ma < 0.01$, fulfilling the stability 
criterion and usage requirements for the presented hydrodynamic model.

The density and velocity of the fluid at each grid point is calculated from the zeroth and first moment of the particle density
distribution, 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \rho &= \sum_i f_i \\
        \rho\vec{u} &= \sum_i f_i \mathbf{c_i}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

The momentum flux tensor is calculated from the Chapman-Enskog expansion of \ref{eq:LBM_BGK} to the first order yielding,

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \rho\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \Pi &= 0 \\
        \Pi_{\alpha \beta} &= \sum_i \mathbf{c_i}_\alpha \mathbf{c_i}_\beta (f_i^{eq} + (1 - \frac{1}{2 \tau})f_i^1)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

The momentum flux tensor can be further expressed as a sum of the equilibrium and non-equilibrium components of the stress tensor, denoted by 0 and 1 given by,

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \Pi^{(0)}_{\alpha \beta} &= \sum_i \mathbf{c_i}_\alpha \mathbf{c_i}_\beta f_i^{eq} = p \delta_{\alpha \beta} + \rho \vec{u}_\alpha \vec{u}_\beta \\
        \Pi^{(1)}_{\alpha \beta} &= (1 - \frac{1}{2 \tau})\sum_i \mathbf{c_i}_\alpha \mathbf{c_i}_\beta f_i^{eq} = \nu (\nabla_{\alpha}(\rho \vec{\beta}) + \nabla_{\beta}(\rho \vec{\alpha}))
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

With $p = \rho c_s^2$ and $\delta_{\alpha \beta}$ the kronecker delta.

\subsection{Non-ideal mixing}
\label{section:lbm_non_ideal_mixing}

The SC model mimics Cahn-Hilliard type behaviour through a force applied from the other fluid species $k'$ in adjacent 
cells $\mathbf{x'}$ on fluid species $k$ at point $\mathbf{x}$. \cite{shan_lattice_1993, shan_simulation_1994, 
shan_multicomponent_1995, he_discrete_1998, jansen_bijels_2011, chin_lattice_2002} Both fluid species are defined
by their own distribution equation defined in Equation \ref{eq:LBM_BGK} The strength of this force is controlled 
through an interaction parameter, $g_{kk'}$ with no contribution from self interaction of the fluid as these are 
set to zero. The SC force can then be written out in Equation \ref{eq:sc_model}.

\begin{equation}
% F_{k}^{SC}(\mathbf{x}, t) = -\Psi^{k}(\mathbf{x}, t)\sum_{k'}g_{cc'}\sum_{\mathbf{x'}}\Psi_{k'}(\mathbf{x'}, t)(\mathbf{x'} 
% - \mathbf{x})
\vec{F}_k(\vec{x}) \Delta t = - \sum_{k'} \sum_i \frac{w_i}{c_s^2} g_{kk'} \psi_k(\vec{x})\psi_{k'}(\vec{x}+\vec{c}_i) \vec{c}_i
\label{eq:sc_model}
\end{equation}

An effective mass of each fluid at node $\mathbf{x}$ is used in place of the actual density to scale it between zero 
and one and is defined as $\psi^{k}(\mathbf{x},t) = \rho_{0}\left[1 - \exp(-\frac{\rho^{k}(\mathbf{x}, t)}{\rho_{0}})\right]$. 
In this model, the SC force is incorporated into the macroscopic velocities that are then used to calculate the equilibrium
distribution $f_{i}^{k, eq}$ for fluid $k$, defined as,

\begin{equation}
\vec{u}_k^{\text{eq}} = \vec{u}' + \frac{\tau_k}{\rho_k} \vec{F}_k
\end{equation}

Where $\vec{u}'$ is defined as the common grid velocity and is calculated from $f_i^k$ below

\begin{equation}
    \sum_k \frac{\rho_k}{\tau_k} \vec{u}' = \sum_k \frac{1}{\tau_k}\sum_i f_i^k\vec{c}_i
\end{equation}

This recasting of the velocity ensures that in the absence of forces, the total momentum of the system is conserved.

\subsection{Suspended particle dynamics}
\label{section:lbm_colloids}

Suspended particles will be coupled to the LB fluid based on the work conducted by Ladd. \cite{ladd_numerical_1994, 
aidun_direct_1998, ladd_lattice-boltzmann_2001} The particles follow Newtonian mechanics with the particle force and
rotational inertia defined using differential equations

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \vec{F_p} = m_p \frac{\vec{u}_p}{dt} , \\
    \vec{D_p} = \mathbf{J}_p \frac{\vec{\omega}_p}{dt} ,
    \label{eq:md}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

$\mathbf{F_p}$ and $\mathbf{D_p}$ represent the force and torque acting on a particle with mass $m_p$ and moment of inertia 
$\mathbf{J}_p$. $\mathbf{u}_p$ and $\mathbf{\omega_{p}}$ are the linear and angular velocities of the particle. The equations of 
motion are evolved over time using a leapfrog integrator. \cite{jansen_bijels_2011}

The particles are discretized on the lattice according to the method laid out in Ladd 1994 and Aidun 1998
\cite{ladd_numerical_1994,aidun_direct_1998}. Nodes representing the particle are marked as solid nodes that replicate
a no-slip boundary condition through a moving bounce-back boundary. This is implemented into the distribution function
by reflecting the outgoing populations of $f_i^k$ to the opposite lattice velocity

\begin{equation}
    f^k_{i^\star}(\vec{x}, t+\Delta t) = f^{k,\star}_i(\vec{x}, t) - \frac{2w_i}{c_s^2} \rho \vec{u}_i \cdot \vec{c}_i ,
\end{equation}

This facilitates momentum exchange between particle and fluid which can be calculated analytically as 
\(\Delta\vec{p}^k_i \frac{\Delta t}{(\Delta x)^3} = 2 f^{k,\star}_i(\vec{x},t)\vec{c}_i - \frac{2w_i}{c_s^2}\rho(\vec{u}_i\cdot\vec{c}_i)\vec{c}_i\).
The sum of the momentum change across the surface of the particle is computed to obtain the force and torque on the particle,

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \vec{F}_p &= \sum_{k,i} \frac{\Delta \vec{p}^k_i}{\Delta t} , \\
    \vec{T}_p &= \sum_{k,i} \frac{\Delta\vec{p}^k_i}{\Delta t} \times \vec{r}_i .
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

As the particle moves, the nodes representing the particle are updated, with newly covered grid points marked as solid and 
uncovered nodes marked as fluid. When a grid point is covered, the momentum contained in that lattice point is added to the 
total force of the particle,

\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_p = -\sum_{k,i} f_i^k(\vec{x},t)\vec{c}_i .
\end{equation}

Upon uncovering of a grid point, it is assigned a density value that represents the average of all adjacent fluid sites,

\begin{equation}
    \rho^k(\vec{x},t) = \frac{1}{N_{\text{f}}} \sum_{i_{\text{f}}} \rho^k(\vec{x}+\vec{c}_{i_{\text{f}}n}, t)
    \label{eq:fill_particles}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Particles near contact}
\label{section:particles_near_contact}

For particles close to contact, meaning with inter-surface distances under 1 lattice unit the hydrodynamics are unresolved as the
distance is smaller than what the model can resolve. Lubrication forces are added to reduce the likelihood of particle overlap. For 
spherical particles, this is defined in Equation \eqref{eq:lubrication}

\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_l = -6 \pi \eta \frac{R_1^2 R_2^2}{\left(R_1+R_2\right)^2}\left(\frac{1}{|\vec{r}_{ij}|-R_1-R_2}-\frac{1}{d_c}\right) \frac{\left(\vec{u}_{12}\cdot\vec{r}_{12}\right)\vec{r}_{12}}{|\vec{r}_{12}|^2} ,% \qquad d<d_c,
    \label{eq:lubrication}
\end{equation}

where $R_i$ and $R_j$ are the radii of each particle involved in the interaction, $\vec{r}_{ij}$ is the distance
vector between the particle centers, $\mathbf{u}_{ij}$ are the relative velocities of the particles and $\Delta_c$ 
is the cutoff distance when the lubrication force begins to act. If particles are able to overcome the lubrication forces, 
a hertzian contact force is also added to ensure that there is no particle overlap, defined in Equation \eqref{eq:hertz}

\begin{equation}
    \phi_{H} = K_{H}(R_i + R_j - |\mathbf{r}_{ij}|)^{5/2}, r < R_i + R_j
    \label{eq:hertz}
\end{equation}

$K_H$ is the force constant used to push particles apart. 

\subsection{Ellipsoidal_particles}
\label{section:ellipsoidal_particles}

To correct for the ellipsoidal particles used in this work, 
the formulas presented in Eqs \ref{eq:lubrication} and \ref{eq:hertz} can be generalized using the route followed 
in Gunther et al. and Davies et al., inspired by Berne and Pechukas. \cite{gunther_timescales_2014, davies_interface_2014} 
They first begin by rewriting the lubrication and Hertzian contact forces as a function of the particle orientation and 
aspect ratio of the particles.

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \phi(\vec{r}_{ij}) &= {\epsilon} \tilde{\phi}\left(\frac{\vec{r}_{ij}}{{\sigma}}\right) , \\
    \vec{F}(\vec{r}_{ij}) &= {\epsilon} \tilde{\vec{F}}\left(\frac{\vec{r}_{ij}}{{\sigma}}\right) .
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

For the lubrication force \eqref{eq:lubrication}, we choose
${\sigma}=R_1+R_2$ and ${\epsilon}=\frac{6\pi\eta R_1^2 R_2^2}{{\sigma^3}}$, and for the
Hertz potential we chose ${\sigma}=R_1+R_2$ and ${\epsilon}=K_H\sigma^{5/2}$. For two identical, rotationally
symmetric ellipsoidal particles with orientations $\hat{\vec{o}}_i$ and $\hat{\vec{o}}_j$, we then replace $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$ by
the anisotropic functions

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \tilde\epsilon\left(\hat{\vec{o}}_i, \hat{\vec{o}}_j\right) &= \frac{{\epsilon}}{\sqrt{1-\chi^2}} , \\
    %\qquad \chi = \frac{\left(\alpha^2-1\right)R_\parallel^2}{\left(\alpha^2+1\right)R_\parallel^2}\left(\hat{\vec{o}}_i\hat{\vec{o}}_j\right) , \\
    \tilde\sigma\left(\vec{r}_{ij}, \hat{\vec{o}}_i, \hat{\vec{o}}_j\right) &= \frac{{\sigma}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{\chi}{2}\left[ \frac{\left(\hat{\vec{r}}_{ij}\cdot\hat{\vec{o}}_i+\hat{\vec{r}}_{ij}\cdot\hat{\vec{o}}_j\right)^2}{1+\chi\left(\hat{\vec{o}}_i\hat{\vec{o}}_j\right)} + \frac{\left(\hat{\vec{r}}_{ij}\cdot\hat{\vec{o}}_i-\hat{\vec{r}}_{ij}\cdot\hat{\vec{o}}_j\right)^2}{1-\chi\left(\hat{\vec{o}}_i\hat{\vec{o}}_j\right)} \right] }} , \\
    \chi &= \frac{\alpha^2-1}{\alpha^2+1} , \\
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

where $R_{\parallel}$ is the particle radius along the
symmetry axis $\hat{o}$ and $\alpha=\frac{R_{\parallel}}{R_{\perp}}$ the aspect
ratio of the particle. The anisotropic Hertz potential and lubrication
force are then defined as
%
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \phi\left(\vec{r}_{ij}, \hat{\vec{o}}_i, \hat{\vec{o}}_j\right) &= \epsilon\left(\hat{\vec{o}}_i, \hat{\vec{o}}_j\right) \tilde{\phi}\left(\frac{\vec{r}_{ij}}{\sigma\left(\vec{r}_{ij}, \hat{\vec{o}}_i, \hat{\vec{o}}_j\right)} \right) , \\
    \vec{F}\left(\vec{r}_{ij}, \hat{\vec{o}}_i, \hat{\vec{o}}_j\right) &= \epsilon\left(\hat{\vec{o}}_i, \hat{\vec{o}}_j\right) \tilde{\vec{F}}\left(\frac{\vec{r}_{ij}}{\sigma\left(\vec{r}_{ij}, \hat{\vec{o}}_i, \hat{\vec{o}}_j\right)} \right) .
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Magnetic field and particle coupling}
\label{section:lbm_colloids_magnetics}

The magnetic dipole potential is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{U_{ij}} = \frac{\mu_0 \vec{m}_i \vec{m}_j}{4\pi |r_{ij}|^{3}} \left[ \vec{o}_i \cdot \vec{o}_j - 
    3(\vec{o}_i \cdot \vec{r}_{ij})(\vec{o}_j \cdot \vec{r}_{ij}) \right]
    \label{eq:magnet_potential}
\end{equation}

Where $\mu_0 = 4\pi \cdot 10^{-7} \frac{H}{m}$,  $\Hat{\mathbf{o_i}}$ is the orientation unit vector of particle 
$i$, $\Hat{\vec{r}_{ij}}$ is the distance vector between particles $i$ and $j$ and $m_i$ is the magnitude the 
magnetic dipole of particle $i$. From the potential, the force and torque of the dipole force between particles 
can be found. These expressions are shown in equations \ref{eq:dipole_magnetic_force} and \ref{eq:dipole_magnetic_torque} 
for the force and torque respectively.

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F}_{ij} = \frac{3 \mu_0}{4 \pi} [\frac{5(\vec{m}_i \cdot \vec{r}_{ij} )(\vec{m}_j
    \cdot \vec{r}_{ij})}{|\vec{r}_{ij}|^7}\vec{r}_{ij} - \frac{(\vec{m}_{i} \cdot \vec{m}_{j})\vec{r}_{ij} + 
    (\vec{m}_{i} \cdot \vec{r}_{ij})\vec{m}_{i} + (\vec{m}_{j} \cdot \vec{r}_{ij})\vec{m}_{j} }{|\vec{r}_{ij}|^5}]
\label{eq:dipole_magnetic_force}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{T}_{ij} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi}[ \frac{3(\vec{m}_{j} \cdot \vec{r}_{ij})m_i \times \vec{r}_{ij} }
    {|\vec{r}_{ij}|^5} - \frac{\vec{m}_{i} \cdot \vec{m}_{j} }{|\vec{r}_{ij}|^3} ]
    \label{eq:dipole_magnetic_torque}
\end{equation}

Equations \ref{eq:magnet_force} and \ref{eq:magnet_torque} are used to calculate the force and torque that the 
field exerts on each particle.

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F_{j}} = \vec{m}_{j}(\vec{o}_{j} \cdot \nabla \vec{B}_{i})
    \label{eq:magnet_force}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{\tau_j} = \vec{m}_{j}(\vec{o}_{j} \times \vec{B}_{i})
    \label{eq:magnet_torque}
\end{equation}

The total force and torque exerted on each particle is the sum of the particle dipole interaction and the field 
dependent contribution.
