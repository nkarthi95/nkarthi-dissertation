		This review addresses recent advances in synthesis strategies of hierarchically porous materials and their structural design from micro-, meso- to macro-length scale. ,

		Owing to their immense potential in energy conversion and storage, catalysis, photocatalysis, adsorption, separation and life science applications, significant interest has been devoted to the design and synthesis of hierarchically porous materials. The hierarchy of materials on porosity, structural, morphological, and component levels is key for high performance in all kinds of applications. Synthesis and applications of hierarchically structured porous materials have become a rapidly evolving field of current interest. A large series of synthesis methods have been developed. This review addresses recent advances made in studies of this topic. After identifying the advantages and problems of natural hierarchically porous materials, synthetic hierarchically porous materials are presented. The synthesis strategies used to prepare hierarchically porous materials are first introduced and the features of synthesis and the resulting structures are presented using a series of examples. These involve templating methods (surfactant templating, nanocasting, macroporous polymer templating, colloidal crystal templating and bioinspired process, i.e. biotemplating), conventional techniques (supercritical fluids, emulsion, freeze-drying, breath figures, selective leaching, phase separation, zeolitization process, and replication) and basic methods (sol-gel controlling and post-treatment), as well as self-formation phenomenon of porous hierarchy. A series of detailed examples are given to show methods for the synthesis of hierarchically porous structures with various chemical compositions (dual porosities: micro-micropores, micro-mesopores, micro-macropores, meso-mesopores, meso-macropores, multiple porosities: micro-meso-macropores and meso-meso-macropores). We hope that this review will be helpful for those entering the field and also for those in the field who want quick access to helpful reference information about the synthesis of new hierarchically porous materials and methods to control their structure and morphology.

		The equilibrium microstructures of ternary oil/water/surfactant mixtures are often classified within a triangular prism. This paper proposes a similar classification for non-equilibrium ternary liquid/fluid/particle mixtures. Distinct microstructures appear in different regions of the prism. ,

		The equilibrium structures of ternary oil/water/surfactant systems are often represented within a triangular composition diagram with various regions of the triangle corresponding to different equilibrium states. We transplant this idea to ternary liquid/fluid/particle systems that are far from equilibrium. Liquid/liquid/particle mixtures or liquid/gas/particle mixtures yield a wide diversity of morphologies including Pickering emulsions, bijels, pendular aggregates, spherical agglomerates, capillary suspensions, liquid marbles, powdered liquids, and particle-stabilized foams. This paper argues that such ternary liquid/fluid/particle mixtures can be unified into a non-equilibrium state diagram. What is common among all these systems is that the morphology results from an interplay between the preferential wettability of the particles, capillarity, and viscous forces encountered during mixing. Therefore all such systems share certain universal features, regardless of the details of the particles or fluids used. These features guide the construction of a non-equilibrium state diagram which takes the form of a triangular prism, where each triangular cross-section of the prism corresponds to a different relative affinity of the particles towards the two fluids. We classify the prism into regions in which the various morphologies appear and also emphasize the major difference between systems in which the particles are fully-wetted by one of the fluids vs. partially-wetted by both fluids. We also discuss how the state diagram may change with mixing intensity or with interparticle attractions.

However, delicate soft matter fibers lack the robustness to be twisted into bundles by means of mechanical rope making tools. Here, weak microfibers with tensile strengths of a few kilopascals are combined into ropes via microfluidic twisting. This is demonstrated for recently introduced fibers made of bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels). Bijels show promising applications in use as membranes, microreactors, energy and healthcare materials, but their low tensile strength make reinforcement strategies imperative. Hydrodynamic twisting allows to produce continuous bijel fiber bundles of controllable architecture. Modelling the fluid flow field reveals the bundle geometry dependence on a subtle force balance composed of rotational and translational shear stresses. Moreover, combining multiple bijel fibers of different compositions enables the introduction of polymeric support fibers to raise the tensile strength to tens of megapascals, while simultaneously preserving the liquid like properties of the bijel fibers for transport applications. Hydrodynamic twisting shows potentials to enable the combination of a wide range of materials resulting in composites with features greater than the sum of their parts.},

		Dynamic Surfactants

		Surfactants are used to form a stable interface between two nonmiscible liquids, like oil and water, so that droplets of one fluid can be entrained in the other.

		Cui et al.

		(p. 460 ) designed a surfactant based on the association of a hydrophilic nanoparticle with a functionalized oleophilic molecule that self-assembles at a water-oil interface to produce a composite surfactant. Once adsorbed, the nanoparticles tend to remain in place causing them to accumulate and “jam” at the interface. When a drop was deformed, more surfactant could assemble at the surface, allowing droplets of various shapes to be produced.

		, A self-assembling composite surfactant can be used to make stable droplets with complex shapes. , Nanoparticles assemble at the interface between two fluids into disordered, liquid-like arrays where the nanoparticles can diffuse laterally at the interface. Using nanoparticles dispersed in water and amine end-capped polymers in oil, nanoparticle surfactants are generated in situ at the interface overcoming the inherent weak forces governing the interfacial adsorption of nanoparticles. When the shape of the liquid domain is deformed by an external field, the surface area increases and more nanoparticles adsorb to the interface. Upon releasing the field, the interfacial area decreases, jamming the nanoparticle surfactants and arresting further shape change. The jammed nanoparticles remain disordered and liquid-like, enabling multiple, consecutive deformation and jamming events. Further stabilization is realized by replacing monofunctional ligands with difunctional versions that cross-link the assemblies. The ability to generate and stabilize liquids with a prescribed shape poses opportunities for reactive liquid systems, packaging, delivery, and storage.

In this study, to expedite the enzymatic conversion of a hydrophobic substrate, we use a bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel (bijel) which provides large interfacial area between two immiscible liquids: oil and water. Using lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of tributyrin as a model reaction in a batch mode, we show that bijels can be used as media to enable enzymatic reaction. The bijel system gives a four-fold increase in the initial reaction rate in comparison to a stirred biphasic medium. Our results demonstrate that bijels are powerful biphasic reaction media to accelerate enzymatic reactions with various hydrophobic reagents. This work also demonstrates that bijels can potentially be used as reaction media to enable continuous reactive separations.},

The study reveals unique internal morphologies including those with through-thickness liquid domains.

These bijels are prepared from common ingredients which are widely used in industry: glycerol, silicone oil, silica nanoparticles together with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ({CTAB}) surfactant. We tune the sample composition and develop a multi-step mixing protocol to achieve a tortuous arrangement of liquid domains. We show that the nanoparticle location changes from one of the phases to the interface during mixing. The changes in both the microscopic and macroscopic sample configuration after a waiting time of months were assessed. In order for the structure to have long-term stability we find that the densities of the two phases must be similar which we achieved by filling one of the phases with nanoparticle-stabilised droplets of the other. This work paves the way to the production of bijels using fully immiscible liquids and hence their exploitation in many application areas.},

The most common interpretation of these phenomena identifies layering of the fluid perpendicular to the shear gradient as the driver for the observed behavior. However, studies of the particle configurations associated with shear thinning and thickening cast doubt on that conclusion and leave unsettled whether these nonequilibrium phenomena are caused primarily by correlated particle motions or by changes in particle packing structure. We report the results of Stokesian dynamics simulations of suspensions of hard spheres that illuminate the relation among the suspension viscosity, shear rate, and particle configuration. Using a recently introduced sampling technique for nonequilibrium systems, we show that shear thinning can be decoupled from layering, thereby eliminating layering as the driver for shear thinning. In contrast, we find that there is a strong correlation between shear thinning and a two-particle measure of the shear stress. Our results are consistent with a recent experimental study.},

		A scalable method to synthesize bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) with uniform sub-micrometer domains is developed. Such bijel films exhibit strong solar reflectance as well as high whiteness in the visible range. ,

		Porous materials possess numerous useful functions because of their high surface area and ability to modulate the transport of heat, mass, fluids, and electromagnetic waves. Unlike highly ordered structures, disordered porous structures offer the advantages of ease of fabrication and high fault tolerance. Bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) are kinetically trapped disordered biphasic materials that can be converted to porous materials with tunable features. Current methods of bijel fabrication result in domains that are micrometers or larger, and non-uniform in size, limiting their surface area, mechanical strength, and interaction with electromagnetic waves. In this work, scalable synthesis of bijels with uniform and sub-micrometer domains is achieved via a two-step solvent removal process. The resulting bijels are characterized quantitatively to verify the uniformity and sub-micrometer scale of the domains. Moreover, these bijels have structures that resemble the microstructure of the scale of the white beetle Cyphochilus. We find that such bijel films with relatively small thicknesses ({\textless}150 μm) exhibit strong solar reflectance as well as high brightness and whiteness in the visible range. Considering their scalability in manufacturing, we believe that {VIPS}-{STRIPS} bijels have great potential in large-scale applications including passive cooling, solar cells, and light emitting diodes ({LEDs}).

		Abstract

		Fluid-bicontinuous gels are unique materials that allow two distinct fluids to interact through a percolating, rigid scaffold. Current restrictions for their use are the large fluid-channel sizes ({\textgreater}5 µm), limiting the fluid-fluid interaction surface-area, and the inability to flow liquids through the channels. In this work a scalable synthesis route of nanoparticle stabilized fluid-bicontinuous gels with channels sizes below 500 nm and specific surface areas of 2 m 2 cm -3 is introduced. Moreover, it is demonstrated that liquids can be pumped through the fluid-bicontinuous gels via electroosmosis. The fast liquid flow in the fluid-bicontinuous gel facilitates their use for molecular separations in continuous-flow liquid-liquid extraction. Together with the high surface areas, liquid flow through fluid-bicontinuous gels enhances their potential as highly permeable porous materials with possible uses as microreaction media, fuel-cell components, and separation membranes.

We first summarize the available simulation methods for colloidal suspensions together with some of the important applications of these methods, and then describe results from lattice-gas and lattice-Boltzmann simulations in more detail. The remainder of the paper is an update of previously published work,(69, 70) taking into account recent research by ourselves and other groups. We describe a lattice-Boltzmann model that can take proper account of density fluctuations in the fluid, which may be important in describing the short-time dynamics of colloidal particles. We then derive macro-dynamical equations for a collision operator with separate shear and bulk viscosities, via the usual multi-time-scale expansion. A careful examination of the second-order equations shows that inclusion of an external force, such as a pressure gradient, requires terms that depend on the eigenvalues of the collision operator. Alternatively, the momentum density must be redefined to include a contribution from the external force. Next, we summarize recent innovations and give a few numerical examples to illustrate critical issues. Finally, we derive the equations for a lattice-Boltzmann model that includes transverse and longitudinal fluctuations in momentum. The model leads to a discrete version of the Green-Kubo relations for the shear and bulk viscosity, which agree with the viscosities obtained from the macro-dynamical analysis. We believe that inclusion of longitudinal fluctuations will improve the equipartition of energy in lattice-Boltzmann simulations of colloidal suspensions.},

		We present rheological evidence demonstrating the glass-like nature of bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels). ,

		We present rheological evidence demonstrating the glass-like nature of bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels). Under small amplitude oscillatory shear, bijels exhibited rheological signatures akin to α and β relaxation that are also invariable to interfacial tension changes, behaviors which are reminiscent of caged particle dynamics found in colloidal glasses, and well described by a previously reported adaptation of mode-coupling theory for colloidal glass rheology. Guided by their rheological signatures and supported by particle detachment and attraction energy approximations, we rationalize that bijels can be represented as 2-dimensional (2D) colloidal glasses that percolate in 3-dimensional (3D) space, and attractive interactions are not required for their stability. To provide further support for this conjecture, we qualitatively compare the rheology of bijels and a capillary suspension that is stabilized by strong, rigid capillary bridges between the particles, beyond their limit of linear viscoelasticity. Our results demonstrate that the strong adsorption of particles to the continuous interface and the lack of strong attractive interparticle forces enable recovery by interfacial tension into new jammed configurations after shear deformation. These behaviors are qualitatively different from those in the capillary suspension, where the breaking of attractive interparticle bonds results in dramatic changes to the microstructure and rheology over a narrow range of shear amplitudes. Our findings unveil bijels as 2D colloidal glasses weaving in 3D space and establish that interparticle attractions are not required for stability in bijels, and interfacial jamming alone is sufficient to impart viscoelasticity and gel-like rheology to these materials.

		Abstract

		This paper presents examples of bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (“bijels”) with a designed gradient in the channel size along the sample. These samples are created by quenching binary fluids which have a gradient in particle concentration along the sample, since the channel size is determined by the local particle concentration. A gradient in local particle concentration is achieved using a two-stage loading process, with different particle volume fractions in each stage. Confocal microscopy and image analysis are used to quantitatively measure the channel size of the bijels. Bijels with a gradient in channel size of up to 2.8\% mm -1 have been created. Such tailored soft materials could act as templates for energy materials optimized for both high ionic transport rates (high power) and high interfacial area (high energy density), potentially making them useful in novel energy applications.

	abstract     = {Bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels or bijels are a new class of soft materials containing both surfactants and particles. They are, however, distinguished from conventional surfactant-stabilized and particle-stabilized systems. Due to the partitioning of percolating sheets of particles in a bicontinuous morphology, the interpenetrating phases are stabilized by kinetically arresting the phase separation process. This leads to the generation of rheological features in bijels with a range of viscoelastic properties based on types, size, anisotropy, and volume fractions of particles. Research on bijels has been around for only about 15 years, and the need for substantial research is recognized in the fabrication of bijels. Herein, the focus is on fabricating on fabricating bijels using solvent transfer-induced phase separation ({STRIPS}) and from polar oils, cationic/anionic surfactants, and various nanoparticles to investigate their microstructure-properties relation. Using the newly emerged liquid-in-liquid 3D printing approach, the fabrication of these bijels via {STRIPS} into arbitrary complex designs which are not reported before is shown. The rheological properties of the printed bijels and the baths used for printing are characterized. This work paves the way for the production of bijels using a broader range of materials and hence their application in various fields.},

		A microsphere migrates by capillarity on a curved fluid interface only if its contact line is pinned. ,

		We address the question: how does capillarity propel microspheres along curvature gradients? For a particle on a fluid interface, there are two conditions that can apply at the three phase contact line: either the contact line adopts an equilibrium contact angle, or it can be pinned by kinetic trapping, e.g. at chemical heterogeneities, asperities, or other pinning sites on the particle surface. We formulate the curvature capillary energy for both scenarios for particles smaller than the capillary length and far from any pinning boundaries. The scale and range of the distortion made by the particle are set by the particle radius; we use singular perturbation methods to find the distortions and to rigorously evaluate the associated capillary energies. For particles with equilibrium contact angles, contrary to the literature, we find that the capillary energy is negligible, with the first contribution bounded to fourth order in the product of the particle radius and the deviatoric curvature of the host interface. For pinned contact lines, we find curvature capillary energies that are finite, with a functional form investigated previously by us for disks and microcylinders on curved interfaces. In experiments, we show microspheres migrate along deterministic trajectories toward regions of maximum deviatoric curvature with curvature capillary energies ranging from 6 * 10 3 -5 * 10 4 k B T . These data agree with the curvature capillary energy for the case of pinned contact lines. The underlying physics of this migration is a coupling of the interface deviatoric curvature with the quadrupolar mode of nanometric disturbances in the interface owing to the particle's contact line undulations. This work is an example of the major implications of nanometric roughness and contact line pinning for colloidal dynamics.

		We probe colloidal organization by considering the interactions of the overlapping distortions of colloids on a curved interface. ,

		Capillary interactions are ubiquitous between colloids trapped at fluid interfaces. Generally, colloids in fluid interfaces have pinned, undulated contact lines that distort the interface around them. To minimize the area, and therefore the energy of these distortions, colloids interact and assemble in a manner that depends on the shape of the host interface. On curved interfaces, capillary interactions direct isolated colloid motion along deviatoric curvature gradients. This directed motion relies on the leading order, long-ranged quadrupolar distortions made by the colloids' undulated pinned contact lines. Here we study pair interactions and dimer formation of colloids on non-uniformly curved fluid interfaces. Pair interaction energies are inferred to be order of 10 4 k B T , and interacting forces are of order 10 -1 {pN} for 10 micron particles adsorbed on interfaces formed around a 250 micron micropost. We compare experiments to analysis for the pair interaction energy, and identify criteria for dimers to form. We also study the formation of trapped structures by multiple particles to discern the influence of the underlying interface shape and the contact line undulations. By comparison to Monte Carlo simulations with potentials of interactions based on analysis, we find that higher order terms in the distortion fields generated by the particles play a major role in the structure formation on the curved interface. These interactions are determined by the particle's contact line and the host interface shape, and can be used to assemble particles independent of their material properties.

We show this in experiments in which the shape of the interface is molded by pinning to vertical pillars of different cross-sections. These interfaces present well-defined curvature fields that orient and steer particles along complex trajectories. Trajectories and orientations are predicted by a theoretical model in which capillary forces and torques are related to Gaussian curvature gradients and angular deviations from principal directions of curvature. Interface curvature diverges near sharp boundaries, similar to an electric field near a pointed conductor. We exploit this feature to induce migration and assembly at preferred locations, and to create complex structures. We also report a repulsive interaction, in which microparticles move away from planar bounding walls along curvature gradient contours. These phenomena should be widely useful in the directed assembly of micro- and nanoparticles with potential application in the fabrication of materials with tunable mechanical or electronic properties, in emulsion production, and in encapsulation.},

Their mechanical properties are relevant to many applications, such as catalysis, energy conversion, soft robotics, and scaffolds for tissue engineering. While their stationary bulk properties have been covered in depth, much less is known about their behavior in the presence of an external shear. In this paper, we numerically study the dynamics of a bijel confined within a three-dimensional rectangular domain and subject to a symmetric shear flow sufficiently intense to break the material. Extensive numerical simulations reveal that the shear flow generally promotes the detachment of a sizable amount of particles from the fluid interface and their accumulation in the bulk. Fluid interfaces undergo large stretching and deformations along the flow direction, an effect that reduces their capability of entrapping particles. These results are supported by a series of quantitative indicators such as (i) curvature of the fluid interface, (ii) spatial distribution of the colloidal particles, and (iii) fluid flow structure within the microchannel.},

		High accuracy Surface Evolver calculations of the orientational transition for anisotropic magnetic particles at liquid interfaces. ,

		We study theoretically the influence of an external magnetic field on the orientation of an ellipsoidal magnetic particle adsorbed at a liquid interface. Using the finite element program Surface Evolver, we calculate the equilibrium meniscus shape around the ellipsoidal particle and its equilibrium tilt angle with respect to the undeformed interface θ t when a magnetic field B is applied perpendicular to the interface. We find that as we increase field strength, θ t increases and at a critical magnetic field B c1 and tilt angle θ c1 , the particle undergoes a discontinuous transition to the 'perpendicular' orientation ( θ t = 90°). Our results agree qualitatively with the simplified theory of Bresme and Faraudo [F. Bresme and J. Faraudo, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter , 2007, 19 , 375110] which assumes that the liquid interface is flat, while they agree quantitatively with recent lattice-Boltzmann simulations of Davies et al. [G. Davies et al. , Soft Matter , 2014, 10 , 6742] which account for the deformation of the liquid meniscus. We also show for the first time that upon reducing the external magnetic field, at a critical magnetic field B c2 {\textless} B c1 , the particle undergoes a second discontinuous transition from the perpendicular orientation to a finite tilt angle θ c2 {\textless} θ c1 . In other words, for micron-sized particles where the thermal energy k B T is negligible compared to the interfacial energy, the tilt angle vs. magnetic field curve exhibits hysteresis behaviour. Due to the higher degree of accuracy of the Surface Evolver method, we are able to analyse the behaviour of the particles near these orientational transitions accurately and study how the critical quantities B c1 , B c2 , θ c1 and θ c2 vary with particle aspect ratio and contact angle.

However, challenges remain in realizing controllable and tunable assembly of particles into diverse structures. Herein, the capillary assembly of magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at a fluid-fluid interface is reported. Depending on their tilt angle, that is, the angle the particle main axis forms with the fluid interface, these particles deform the interface and generate capillary dipoles or hexapoles. Driven by capillary interactions, multiple particles thus assemble into chain-, hexagonal-lattice-, and ring-like structures, which can be actively controlled by applying an external magnetic field. A field-strength phase diagram is predicted in which various structures are present as stable states. Owing to the diversity, controllability, and tunability of assembled structures, magnetic ellipsoidal Janus particles at fluid interfaces could therefore serve as versatile building blocks for novel materials.},

		Magnetic ellipsoidal particles adsorbed at a fluid-fluid interface create dipolar interface deformations in response to a magnetic field, which affects their orientation and may lead to novel particle monolayer structures. ,

		Manufacturing new soft materials with specific optical, mechanical and magnetic properties is a significant challenge. Assembling and manipulating colloidal particles at fluid interfaces is a promising way to make such materials. We use lattice-Boltzmann simulations to investigate the response of magnetic ellipsoidal particles adsorbed at liquid-liquid interfaces to external magnetic fields. We provide further evidence for the first-order orientation phase transition predicted by Bresme and Faraudo [ Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter , 2007, 19 , 375110]. We show that capillary interface deformations around the ellipsoidal particle significantly affect the tilt-angle of the particle for a given dipole-field strength, altering the properties of the orientation transition. We propose scaling laws governing this transition, and suggest how to use these deformations to facilitate particle assembly at fluid-fluid interfaces.

		A three-dimensional gyroid-inspired architecture composed of turbostratic graphene was fabricated using colloidal self-assembly and chemical vapor deposition. ,

		Three-dimensional porous architectures of graphene are desirable for energy storage, catalysis, and sensing applications. Yet it has proven challenging to devise scalable methods capable of producing co-continuous architectures and well-defined, uniform pore and ligament sizes at length scales relevant to applications. This is further complicated by processing temperatures necessary for high quality graphene. Here, bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) are formed and processed into sacrificial porous Ni scaffolds for chemical vapor deposition to produce freestanding three-dimensional turbostratic graphene (bi-3DG) monoliths with high specific surface area. Scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) images show that the bi-3DG monoliths inherit the unique microstructural characteristics of their bijel parents. Processing of the Ni templates strongly influences the resultant bi-3DG structures, enabling the formation of stacked graphene flakes or fewer-layer continuous films. Despite the multilayer nature, Raman spectra exhibit no discernable defect peak and large relative intensity for the Raman 2D mode, which is a characteristic of turbostratic graphene. Moiré patterns, observed in scanning tunneling microscopy images, further confirm the presence of turbostratic graphene. Nanoindentation of macroscopic pillars reveals a Young's modulus of 30 {MPa}, one of the highest recorded for sp 2 carbon in a porous structure. Overall, this work highlights the utility of a scalable self-assembly method towards porous high quality graphene constructs with tunable, uniform, and co-continuous microstructure.

	abstract     = {The discovery of bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) in 2007 motivated the development of processing techniques to harness their unique morphological attributes in applications such as electrochemical energy storage and conversion, catalysis, and regenerative biomaterials. These techniques are primarily based on selective polymerization of one phase, and subsequent chemical processing of the resultant scaffold into porous, micro-architectured materials. A significant limitation of these protocols is the need to transport polymer precursors into one of the fluid phases after bijel formation, a time-consuming step that can also impose disruptive gravitational and interfacial stresses, sometimes causing a complete breakdown of the bijel backbone. Here, we introduce a class of intrinsically polymerizable bijels ({IPBs}) comprising partially miscible mixtures of solvent and poly(ethylene glycol) precursor, which can be directly transformed into bijel-templated materials ({BTMs}), completely bypassing the precursor transport step and relaxing the associated limitations of previous protocols. To achieve selective polymerization, we incorporated into the mixture a common fluorescent dye, sodium fluorescein, which had strong affinity for the monomer-poor phase. Spectrophotometry experiments demonstrated a local photon quenching effect due to the fluorescent dye, which in turn curtailed activation of the photoinitiator and thus prevented polymerization in the monomer-poor phase. We establish the generality of our approach by using different monomers and monomer blends, and demonstrate how this modularity enables tuning of the mechanical properties of {BTMs}, measured by flexural testing. Our protocol establishes a scalable and efficient platform for producing {BTMs}, paving the way for their protential applications in emerging technologies.},

Additionally, the electrospinning technique allows a uniform pore size, which is considered to be one of the important characteristics of membranes. Therefore, electrospun nanofibrous membranes have been used in water purification applications. Furthermore, the technique is widely utilized for generating membranes for membrane distillation and nanofiltration processes, for the removal of contaminants. However, in this review paper, more emphasis is given to the optimization of specific parameters and the preparation of polymeric solutions for fabricating specialized nanofibrous non-woven membranes, and surface modification for application in water treatment technology.

As an example, the more and more stringent regulations on the products for home and personal care are pushing the market towards the use of biodegradable materials in order to reduce their environmental impact. In this scenario, an appealing opportunity is offered by the use of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles ({NPs}) for the stabilization of fragrance oils in water. In this work, modular biodegradable {NPs} have been synthesized through a combination of ring opening polymerization and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer emulsion polymerization and used to produce limonene-in-water Pickering emulsions. This strategy allowed controlling independently the {NP} size, polymer molecular weight, and hydrophobicity acting on the microstructure of the constituting copolymers. Stable limonene-in-water Pickering emulsions could be obtained, with the size of the oil phase and the wetting by limonene that can be strictly controlled by tuning the {NP} physico-chemical properties. Finally, the adoption of thermo-responsive polymer chains within the shell of the Pickering emulsifiers enabled the on-demand destabilization of the emulsions and hence the selective dispensing of limonene by simply increasing the temperature.},

	abstract     = {Bicontinuous Pickering emulsions (bijels) are a physically interesting class of soft materials with many potential applications including catalysis, microfluidics and tissue engineering. They are created by arresting the spinodal decomposition of a partially-miscible liquid with a (jammed) layer of interfacial colloids. Porosity L (average interfacial separation) of the bijel is controlled by varying the radius (r) and volume fraction (ϕ) of the colloids (L ∝ r/ϕ). However, to optimize the bijel structure with respect to other parameters, e.g. quench rate, characterizing by L alone is insufficient. Hence, we have used confocal microscopy and X-ray {CT} to characterize a range of bijels in terms of local and area-averaged interfacial curvatures; we further demonstrate that bijels are bicontinuous using an image-analysis technique known as 'region growing'. In addition, the curvatures of bijels have been monitored as a function of time, which has revealed an intriguing evolution up to 60 minutes after bijel formation, contrary to previous understanding.},

A Gibbs-Duhem-type thermodynamic formalism is introduced to treat heterogeneous pressure within the phenomenological model, in agreement with Young-Laplace equation. Computer simulations are performed to study the effects of capillary forces (interfacial tension and Laplace pressure) on particle self-assembly at fluid interfaces in various two-dimensional cases. For isolated particles, it is found that the equilibrium liquid interface remains circular and particles of different shapes do not disturb the homogeneous curvature of liquid interface, while the equilibrium position, orientation and stability of a particle at the liquid interface depend on its shape and initial location with respect to the liquid interface. For interacting particles, the curvature of local liquid interfaces is different from the apparent curvature of the particle shell; nevertheless, irrespective of the particle shapes, a particle-coated droplet always tends to deform into a circular morphology under positive Laplace pressure, loses mechanical stability and collapses under negative Laplace pressure, while adapts to any morphology and stays in neutral equilibrium under zero Laplace pressure. Finally, the collective behaviors of particles and Laplace pressure evolution in bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) are investigated.},

Right: hydrophobic silica (red) jam interface to form nonpolar bigel. , Bicontinuous, interfacially jammed, emulsion gels (bijels) are a novel class of materials composed of two immiscible phases with interpenetrating domains that are stabilized by a monolayer of colloidal particles at the interface. However, existing bijel systems so far all consist of at least one polar fluid, which is believed to be essential to induce electrostatic repulsion for stabilizing interfacial particles. It is not known whether two nonpolar fluids can form a bijel. Here, we experimentally achieve a bijel using styrene trimer and low molecular weight polybutene—two nonpolar fluids that are similar to polymer blends, which are important in technical applications. By combining laser scanning confocal microscopy, cryo-{SEM} and rheology measurement, we systematically investigate the dynamics and rheology of this nonpolar bijel. In contrast to previous studies on polar bijels, we observe the formation of localized regions of high particle concentration or “particle patches” on the interface which assemble during coarsening. We also provide the first quantitative relation between the morphology of a bijel, the interfacial particle coverage and the shear modulus during bijel coarsening. Moreover, we reveal a previously unnoticed increase in the elastic modulus of bijels that can be attributed to the rearrangement of interfacial particles at long time scales. In addition, we also found a hydrophobic particle framework that survives after the direct remixing of the nonpolar bijel. Our study provides important insights into the formation of bijels and is the first step to explore the missing link between polar bijels and particle-stabilized bicontinuous polymer blends.},

	abstract     = {Monodispersed iron oxide nanoparticles ({IONPs}) coated with polystyrenesulfonate ({PSS}) and cetrimonium bromide ({CTAB}) have been used to stabilize magnetic Pickering emulsions ({MPEs}). Magnetophoresis of {MPEs} under the inﬂuence of a low gradient magnetic ﬁeld (∇B {\textless} 100 T/m) was investigated at the macroscopic and microscopic scale. At the macroscopic scale, for the case of {pH} 7, the {MPE} achieved a magnetophoretic velocity of 70.9 μm/s under the inﬂuence of ∇B at 93.8 T/m. The magnetic separation eﬃciency of the {MPE} at 90\% was achieved within 30 min for {pH} 3, 7, and 10. At {pH} 10, the colloidal stability of the {MPE} was the lowest compared to that for {pH} 3 and 7. Thus, {MPE} at {pH} 10 required the shortest time for achieving the highest separation eﬃciency, as the {MPE} experienced cooperative magnetophoresis at alkaline {pH}. The creaming rate of the {MPE} at all conditions was still lower compared to magnetophoresis and was negligible in inﬂuencing its separation kinetics proﬁles. At the microscopic scale, the migration pathways of the {MPEs} (with diameters between 2.5 and 7.5 μm) undergoing magnetophoresis at ∇B ∼ 13.0 T/m were recorded by an optical microscope. From these experiments, and taking into consideration the {MPE} size distribution from the dynamic light scattering ({DLS}) measurement, we determined the averaged microscopic magnetophoretic velocity to be 7.8 ± 5.5 μm/s. By making noncooperative magnetophoresis assumptions (with negligible interactions between the {MPEs} along their migration pathways), the calculated velocity of individual {MPEs} was 9.8 μm/s. Such a value was within the percentage error of the experimental result of 7.8 ± 5.5 μm/s. This ﬁnding allows for an easy and quick estimation of the magnetophoretic velocity of {MPEs} at the microscale by using macroscopic separation kinetics data.},

However, directing and controlling particles into highly tunable and predictable structures, while essential, is a challenge. We present a liquid interface assisted approach to fabricate nanoparticle structures with tunable properties. To demonstrate its feasibility, we study magnetic Janus particles adsorbed at the interface of a spherical droplet placed on a substrate. With an external magnetic field turned on, a single particle moves to the location where its position vector relative to the droplet center is parallel to the direction of the applied field. Multiple magnetic Janus particles arrange into reconfigurable hexagonal lattice structures and can be directed to assemble at desirable locations on the droplet interface by simply varying the magnetic field direction. We develop an interface energy model to explain our observations, finding excellent agreement. Finally, we demonstrate that the external magnetic field allows one to tune the particle deposition pattern obtained when the droplet evaporates. Our results have implications for the fabrication of varied nanostructures on substrates for use in nanodevices, organic electronics, or advanced display, printing, and coating applications.},

We first summarize the available simulation methods for colloidal suspensions together with some of the important applications of these methods, and then describe results from lattice-gas and lattice-Boltzmann simulations in more detail. The remainder of the paper is an update of previously published work,(69, 70) taking into account recent research by ourselves and other groups. We describe a lattice-Boltzmann model that can take proper account of density fluctuations in the fluid, which may be important in describing the short-time dynamics of colloidal particles. We then derive macro-dynamical equations for a collision operator with separate shear and bulk viscosities, via the usual multi-time-scale expansion. A careful examination of the second-order equations shows that inclusion of an external force, such as a pressure gradient, requires terms that depend on the eigenvalues of the collision operator. Alternatively, the momentum density must be redefined to include a contribution from the external force. Next, we summarize recent innovations and give a few numerical examples to illustrate critical issues. Finally, we derive the equations for a lattice-Boltzmann model that includes transverse and longitudinal fluctuations in momentum. The model leads to a discrete version of the Green-Kubo relations for the shear and bulk viscosity, which agree with the viscosities obtained from the macro-dynamical analysis. We believe that inclusion of longitudinal fluctuations will improve the equipartition of energy in lattice-Boltzmann simulations of colloidal suspensions.},

	abstract     = {, Herein, a smart strategy is proposed to tailor unique interwoven nanocable architecture consisting of {MnCoOx} nanoparticles embedded in one-dimensional (1D) mesoporous N-doped carbon nanofibers ({NCNFs}) by using electrospinning technique. The as-prepared network mat of N-doped carbon nanofibers with embedded {MnCoOx} nanoparticles ({MnCoOx}@{NCNFs}) is tested as a current collector-free and binder-free flexible anode, which eliminates slurry preparation process during electrode fabrication in the Li-ion battery ({LIB}). The {MnCoOx}@{NCNFs} possess versatile structural characteristics that can address simultaneously different issues such as poor conductivity, low cycling stability, volume variation, flexibility, and binder issue associate with the metal oxide. The free-standing mat electrode shows not only high initial discharge and charge capacities but also reversible discharge cycling stability of almost 80\% retention up to 100 cycles and 60\% retention up to 500 cycles at 1.0 A/g. Such high Li storage capacity and excellent cycling stability are attributed to the unique flexible and free-standing spider network-like architecture of the 1D {MnCoOx}@{NCNFs} that provides the platform for bicontinuous electron/ion pathways for superior electrochemical performance. Along with excellent electrochemical performance, simple synthesis procedure of unique binder-free {MnCoOx}@{NCNFs} can achieve cost-effective scalable mass production for practical use in a flexible mode, not merely in {LIBs} but also in a wide spectrum of energy storage fields.},

Die Genauigkeit der älteren Formeln wird untersucht und die bis jetzt unbekannten Konstanten dieser Formeln werden berechnet. Sodann wird die Theorie geprüft an Messungen der Leitfähigkeit bei heterogenen Metallegierungen und an den DK. von gepreßten Pulvern und Emulsionen; die verschiedenen Formeln werden bestätigt. Bei dieser Anwendung werden einige Widersprüche zwischen früheren Untersuchungen aufgehoben und es wird versucht, einige ungenau bekannte DK. genauer zu bestimmen.},

Finding diverse application from optics to bubble formation, it received considerable attention in fuel cell and battery research, recently. The ability to estimate tortuous mass transport resistance based on porosity alone is attractive, because direct access to the tortuosity factors is notoriously difficult. The correlation, however, has limitations, which are not widely appreciated owing to the limited accessibility of the original manuscript. We retrace Bruggeman's derivation, together with its initial assumptions, and comment on validity and limitations apparent from the original work to offer some guidance on its use.},

	abstract     = {Lattice Boltzmann simulations of bijels stabilized by ellipsoidal magnetic particles in external magnetic fields demonstrate the potential of magnetic particles for fabrication of emulsion systems with tunable, anisotropic properties. , Bicontinuous interfacially-jammed emulsion gels (bijels) are increasingly used as emulsion templates for the fabrication of functional porous materials including membranes, electrodes, and biomaterials. Control over the domain size and structure is highly desirable in these applications. For bijels stabilized by spherical particles, particle size and volume fraction are the main parameters that determine the emulsion structure. Here, we investigate the use of ellipsoidal magnetic particles and study the effect of external magnetic fields on the formation of bijels. Using hybrid Lattice Boltzmann-molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze the effect of the magnetic field on emulsion dynamics and the structural properties of the resulting bijel. We find that the formation of bijels remains robust in the presence of magnetic fields, and that the domain size and tortuosity become anisotropic when ellipsoidal particles are used. We show that the magnetic fields lead to orientational ordering of the particles which in turn leads to alignment of the interfaces. The orientational order facilitates enhanced packing of particles in the interface which leads to different jamming times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the field. Our results highlight the potential of magnetic particles for fabrication and processing of emulsion systems with tunable properties.},

B 28, 784 (1983)10.1103/PhysRevB.28.784] has become a standard tool in condensed matter physics, with applications including glass, jamming, melting or crystallization transitions, and cluster formation. Here, we discuss two fundamental flaws in the definition of these parameters that significantly affect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a remedy. First, the definition of the bond-orientational order parameters considers the geometrical arrangement of a set of nearest neighboring (NN) spheres, NN(p), around a given central particle p; we show that the choice of neighborhood definition can have a bigger influence on both the numerical values and qualitative trend of ql than a change of the physical parameters, such as packing fraction. Second, the discrete nature of neighborhood implies that NN(p) is not a continuous function of the particle coordinates; this discontinuity, inherited by ql, leads to a lack of robustness of the ql as structure metrics. Both issues can be avoided by a morphometric approach leading to the robust Minkowski structure metrics {\textbackslash}documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\}{\textbackslash}begin\{document\}\$q\_l{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}\${\textbackslash}end\{document\}ql′.

We used a colloidal glass to obtain direct three-dimensional images of thermally induced structural rearrangements in the presence of an applied shear. We identified localized irreversible shear transformation zones and determined their formation energy and topology. A transformation favored successive ones in its vicinity. Using continuum models, we elucidated the interplay between applied strain and thermal fluctuations that governs the formation of these zones in both colloidal and molecular glasses.},

Integration of MOFs on polymeric fibrous scaffolds will enable new applications in gas adsorption, membrane separation, catalysis, and toxic gas sensing. Here, we demonstrate a new synthesis route for growing MOFs on fibrous materials that achieves high MOF loadings, large surface areas and high adsorptive capacities. We find that a nanoscale coating of Al 2 O 3 formed by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on the surface of nonwoven fiber mats facilitates nucleation of MOFs on the fibers throughout the mat. Functionality of MOFs is fully maintained after integration, and MOF crystals are well attached to the fibers. Breakthrough tests for HKUST-1 MOFs [Cu 3 (BTC) 2 ] on ALD-coated polypropylene fibers reveal NH 3 dynamic loadings up to 5.93 ± 0.20 mol/kg (MOF+fiber) . Most importantly, this synthetic approach is generally applicable to a wide range of polymer fibers (e.g., PP, PET, cotton) and MOFs (e.g., HKUST-1, MOF-74, and UiO-66).},

It was proved also that these de-solutions and coagulations of proteid were not due to the action of enzymes, heat, or surface evaporation, and were not appreciably affected by the nature of the gas in contact with the liquid or of the vessel in which the agitation was effected. A prolonged series of further experiments, undertaken with a view of ascertaining the precise cause of this phenomenon, has led me to the discovery of an important, but hitherto unnoticed physical fact:—namely, that, quite apart from evaporation, solid or highly viscous coatings are spontaneously, and more or less rapidly formed on the free surfaces of all proteid solutions.},

Lett. 102, 066103 (2009)]10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.066103 of nanoparticles at an idealised liquid-liquid interface showed that the nanoparticle-interface interaction range was larger than expected due, in part, to the action of thermal capillary waves. In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations of a Lennard-Jones nanoparticle in a binary Lennard-Jones mixture are used to confirm that these previous results hold for more realistic models. Furthermore by including attractive interactions between the nanoparticle and the solvent, it is found that the detachment energy decreases as the nanoparticle-solvent attraction increases. Comparison between the simulation results and recent theoretical predictions [H. Lehle and M. Oettel, J. Phys. Condens.

	abstract     = {In recent years, emulsions stabilized by micro- or nanoparticles (known as Pickering emulsions) have attracted much attention. Micro- or nanoparticles, as the main components of the emulsion, play a key role in the preparation and application of Pickering emulsions. The existence of particles at the interface between the oil and aqueous phases affects not only the preparation, but also the properties of Pickering emulsions, affording superior stability, low toxicity, and stimuli-responsiveness compared to classical emulsions stabilized by surfactants. These advantages of Pickering emulsions make them attractive, especially in biomedicine. In this review, the effects of the characteristics of micro- and nanoparticles on the preparation and properties of Pickering emulsions are introduced. In particular, the preparation methods of Pickering emulsions, especially uniform-sized emulsions, are listed. Uniform Pickering emulsions are convenient for both mechanistic research and applications. Furthermore, some biomedical applications of Pickering emulsions are discussed and the problems hindering their clinical application are identified.},

In this work, we numerically investigate the suitability of three topologically very different architected materials for long bone implants: the octet truss-based lattice, the Schwartz P minimal surface-based lattice and the spinodal stochastic surface-based lattice. Each implant topology (reinforcement) and its surrounding tissue (soft matrix) are modeled as a composite system via finite element analysis. Performance metrics are defined based on the Young's modulus, the peak stress under service conditions, the interfacial surface area per unit volume and the relative bone growth rate (estimated based on the strain transferred to the soft matrix). We show that surface-based topologies are less prone to fatigue failure and may promote superior bone growth than conventional truss-based designs. Spinodal surface-based architected materials have the best performance, and can be fabricated via self-assembly approaches followed by material conversion, potentially allowing scalable fabrication of implants with unit cell sizes at the micro-scale, thus dramatically amplifying surface area per unit volume and bone growth efficiency.},

	abstract     = {Abstract Bicontinuous, interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) are a class of soft solid materials in which interpenetrating domains of two immiscible fluids are stabilized by an interfacial colloidal monolayer. Such structures form through the arrest of the spinodal decomposition of an initially single-phase liquid mixture containing a colloidal suspension. With the use of hexalmethyldisilazane, the wetting character of silica colloids, ranging in size and dye content, can be modified for fabricating a novel bijel system comprising the binary liquid ethanediol-nitromethane. Unlike the preceding water-lutidine based system, this bijel is stable at room temperature and its fabrication and resultant manipulation are comparatively straightforward. The new system has facilitated three advancements: firstly, we use sub 100 nm silica particles to stabilize the first bijel made from low molecular weight liquids that has domains smaller than ten micrometers. Secondly, our new and robust bijel permits qualitative rheological work which reveals the bijel to be significantly elastic and self healing whilst its domains are able to break, reform and locally rearrange. Thirdly, we encapsulate the ethanediol-nitromethane bijel in Pickering drops to form novel particle-stabilized bicontinuous multiple emulsions that we christen bijel capsules. These emulsions are stimuli responsive - they liberate their contained materials in response to changes in temperature and solvency, and hence they show potential for controlled release applications.},

	abstract     = {Shear-induced melting and crystallization were investigated by confocal microscopy in concentrated colloidal suspensions of hard-sphere-like particles. Both silica and polymethylmethacrylate suspensions were sheared with a constant rate in either a countertranslating parallel plate shear cell or a counterrotating cone-plate shear cell. These instruments make it possible to track particles undergoing shear for extended periods of time in a plane of zero velocity. Although on large scales, the flow profile deviated from linearity, the crystal flowed in an aligned sliding layer structure at low shear rates. Higher shear rates caused the crystal to shear melt, but, contrary to expectations, the transition was not sudden. Instead, although the overall order decreased with shear rate, this was due to an increase in the nucleation of localized domains that temporarily lost and regained their ordered structure. Even at shear rates that were considered to have melted the crystal as a whole, ordered regions kept showing up at times, giving rise to very large fluctuations in 2D bond-orientational order parameters. Low shear rates induced initially disordered suspensions to crystallize. This time, the order parameter increased gradually in time without large fluctuations, indicating that shear-induced crystallization of hard spheres does not proceed via a nucleation and growth mechanism. We conclude that the dynamics of melting and crystallization under shear differ dramatically from their counterparts in quiescent suspensions.},

	abstract     = {Liquid crystals are important condensed matter systems for technological applications, as well as for fundamental studies. , Liquid crystals are important condensed matter systems for technological applications, as well as for fundamental studies. An important unresolved issue is the nature of the phase transition in a two-dimensional (2D) liquid crystal system. In contrast to numerous computational studies reported in the last few decades, there have been no convincing experiments to verify these numerical results. Anisotropic colloids provide an excellent experimental model system to study phase transitions, such as crystallization and glass transition in condensed matter physics with single particle resolution. However, using colloids to probe the two-dimensional liquid crystal transition remains a challenge, since the condensed anisotropic colloids usually become stuck in the metastable glassy state rather than approaching their equilibrium liquid crystal phase. Here we report a method of using an external magnetic field to assist a colloidal system of super-paramagnetic anisotropic particles to overcome the local free energy barriers in the metastable states and approach the equilibrium phase. The experiments demonstrate a 2D isotropic-nematic phase transition with increasing packing density. The effects of the anisotropy of the colloidal particles on the 2D isotropic-nematic transition are explored. Our experimental results are compared with those from previous computational work, and quantitative agreements are reached.},

Motivated by the intricate coupling between hydrodynamics and the interactions of fluid-filled bodies, several methods have been developed. The objective of this review is to present a compact foundation of the methods used in the literature in the context of lattice Boltzmann methods. For hydrodynamics, we focus on the lattice Boltzmann method due to its specific ability to treat time- and spatial-dependent boundary conditions and to incorporate new physical models in a computationally efficient way. We split the existing methods into two groups with regard to the interfacial boundary: fluid-structure and fluid-fluid methods. The fluid-structure methods are characterised by the coupling between fluid dynamics and mechanics of the flowing body, often used in applications involving membranes and similar flexible solid boundaries. We further divide fluid-structure-based methods into two subcategories, those which treat the fluid-structure boundary as a continuum medium and those that treat it as a discrete collection of individual springs and particles. Next, we discuss the fluid-fluid methods, particularly useful for the simulations of fluid-fluid interfaces. We focus on models for immiscible droplets and their interaction in a suspending fluid and describe benchmark tests to validate the models for fluid-filled bodies.},

These {LC} {HAp} nanorod materials are macroscopically oriented in response to external magnetic fields and mechanical forces. We achieve magnetic modulation of the optical transmission by dynamic control of the {LC} order. Atomic-scale observations using transmission electron microscopy show the self-organized inorganic/organic hybrid structures of mesogenic nanorods. {HAp} liquid crystals have potential as bio-friendly functional materials because of their facile preparation, the bio-friendliness of {HAp}, and the stimuli-responsive properties of these colloidal ordered fluids.},

We show that the ellipsoidal shape approximations that assume a uniform internal magnetic field are only valid for small deformations (aspect ratio a/b ≈ 4). For large droplet deformations, the non-uniformity in the field within the droplet becomes substantial, rendering such approximations to be invalid. To overcome the limitations of ellipsoidal theory, we perform numerical simulations to determine volume averaged demagnetization factor and fields. Based on the numerical simulations, we propose semi-analytical relationships to describe small and large deformations for magnetic droplets using volume averaged methods. We test and validate our results with the existing experimental results and find an excellent agreement between our model and experimental studies. We extend our analysis and investigate static and dynamic droplets with conical tips. We show that droplets with conical tips could be defined solely by the characteristic half cone angle. We analyze unstable droplets with extremely high susceptibility χ → ∞ and find that conical tips with a half cone angle of θc ≈ 30° and an aspect ratio of ≈3.7 are formed prior to breakup, in agreement with the prior experimental studies of charged electric droplet breakup. We show that the volume averaged methods derived for droplets with finite tip curvature are also valid and in good agreement with the computational and previous experimental studies of magnetic droplets with conical tips.},

However, the irreversible adsorption of particles as emulsion stabilizers endows the Pickering emulsions with kinetically stable property, resulting in a huge challenge to break the stability. Here we fabricated microscale Pickering emulsions, by the use of paramagnetic particles, which possess excellent stability for several months and more interestingly perform complete demulsification under controllable magnetic fields in several minutes. The alternating asymmetrical magnetic field endows oil-in-water droplets ''big'' N and S poles on the outer particle layers, and attracts the solid particles to the bottom of the vial after the coalescence and the deformation of the droplets, bringing the prevention of re-emulsion and the cyclic utilization. This facile strategy to produce stable Pickering emulsions with a magnetic-response opens a promising avenue for various practical applications including oil recovery, wastewater treatment, and sludge removal.},

	abstract     = {The anisotropic properties of clay-rich porous media have significant impact on the directional dependence of fluids migration in environmental and engineering sciences. This anisotropy, linked to the preferential orientation of flat anisometric clay minerals particles, is studied here on the basis of the simulation of three-dimensional packings of non-interacting disks, using a sequential deposition algorithm under a gravitational field. Simulations show that the obtained porosities fall onto a single master curve when plotted against the anisotropy value. This finding is consistent with results from sedimentation experiments using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) disks and subsequent extraction of particle anisotropy through X-ray microtomography. Further geometrical analyses of computed porous media highlight that both particle orientation and particle aggregation are responsible of the evolution of porosity as a function of anisotropy. Moreover, morphological analysis of the porous media using chord length measurements shows that the anisotropy of the pore and solid networks can be correlated with particle orientation. These results indicate that computed porous media, mimicking the organization of clay minerals, can be used to shed light on the anisotropic properties of fluid transfer in clay-based materials.},
